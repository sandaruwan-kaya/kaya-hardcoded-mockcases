🤖 **Investor Guidelines Parser Agent thinking...**
- Extracts thresholds:
  - Modification requires DTI ≤ 45%, hardship temporary. 
  - Forbearance requires hardship ≤ 12 months. 
  - Short Sale / DIL permitted if DTI > 55% OR hardship permanent. 
  - Repayment Plan: Delinquent < 3 months, post-plan DTI ≤ 50%. 
  - Continue Current: If no delinquency/hardship.

#### Structured Rule Matrix

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modification        | Post-mod DTI ≤ 45%, LTV ≤ 110%, hardship temporary (< 6 months)          |
| Forbearance         | Post-forbearance DTI ≤ 55%, hardship expected to resolve within 12 months |
| Short Sale          | DTI > 55% OR hardship permanent; property marketed per investor rules     |
| Deed in Lieu        | Same as Short Sale but borrower opts for direct transfer of title         |
| Continue as Current | No delinquency, current on payments, no hardship                          |
| Repayment Plan      | Delinquent < 3 months, stable income, DTI ≤ 50% post-plan                 |

#### Sample Email to Jason

### Subject: Outcome of Loss Mitigation Review

Dear Jason,

Based on our review of your financial profile and circumstances, we have determined that the most appropriate course of action is: Modification (with compensating factors). 

This decision is based on your current Debt-to-Income ratio, Loan-to-Value ratio, credit history, and the nature of your (temporary 3-month) hardship, as compared against our investor's guidelines. 

**Details:**
- Risk Category: High Risk (45) 
- Reason: Post-mod DTI ≈ 45.3% using 3.5% rate and 480-month term; LTV 105.0% ≤ 110%. 
- Key Parameters (Before → After): DTI 61.0% → 45.3%; LTV 105.0% → 105.0%; FICO 590 → 595 (illustrative). 

**Disclaimer / Forward-Looking View:**

Please note: This modification approval assumes your hardship resolves within approximately 3 months. If your hardship becomes permanent or your income decreases materially, we will re-evaluate your eligibility and may consider forbearance or liquidation options. 

If your situation changes before the end of the review period, please notify us immediately so we can reassess your eligibility and options

Regards,

Loan Servicing Team
